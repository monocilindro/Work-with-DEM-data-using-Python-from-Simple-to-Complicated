# Work-with-DEM-data-using-Python-from-Simple-to-Complicated
Work with DEM data using Python from Simple to Complicated. Many python packages will be touched such as GDAL, numpy, xarray, rasterio, folium, cartopy, geopandas etc.

1. Visualize Elevation Contours from DEM data

2. Histograms of DEM Values

3. Deal with DEM in ASCIIGRID Format

4. Clip GeoTIFF Data With a Shapefile

5. Reproject DEM

6. Hillshade from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

7. Watershed Delineation from DEM

8. Exploratory Flood Inundation Model with Flood Fill Algorithm

9. Inundation Estimation with RFSM

10. Visualize DEM in An Interactive Map

11. Reclassify DEM
12. Merge Overlapping Rasters Using R and Terra
13. Merge Overlapping Rasters Using python and rioxarray
14. Merge Overlapping Rasters Using Python and GDAL VRT Pixel Functions
15. Vectorize - Extract Raster Boundry to GeoDataFrame

Sup01-Quickly Visualize DEM Attributes with Datashader

Sup02-DEM, DTM, DSM and Canopy Height Model

Sup03-Ridgelines Map of DEM

To simiplify data reading and prepocessing, xarray (backended with rasterio) is used as possible as I can.
Hope these tutorials are a little bit helpful to you. 

Being a data scientist (maybe the only one in your company), sometimes, you will feel very bored, 
and the best way to get rid of it is to keep coding with python :).

Many thanks to those people who develop and maintian python packages involved in this tutorial.
